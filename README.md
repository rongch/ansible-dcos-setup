# dcos-setup

This repo uses [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/) to configure a [Mesosphere](https://mesosphere.com/) stack following the [DC/OS Advanced Installation Guide](https://dcos.io/docs/1.7/administration/installing/custom/advanced/)

Currently all inventory IPs are hardcoded in the hosts.ini file. This will be updated to dynamic variables in the future. For now you must modify the following files with the correct values:

- [hosts.ini](https://github.com/OldCrowEW/dcos-ansible/blob/master/hosts.ini)
- [group_vars/all](https://github.com/OldCrowEW/dcos-ansible/blob/master/group_vars/all)

** Notice the hosts.ini file has hostname set with ansible_host= override to public IP.

## Usage
